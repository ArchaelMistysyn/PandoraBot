2,Definitely Not Lost,Pleasure doing business with you. I do hope you have a map of this labyrinth. It really would be a shame if we got lost in here and met an unfortunate end. Perhaps we will even find some treasure.,1,2,,Use the /map command,1000,500,i4y,1,
3,Crush The Castle,I'm so glad to see you're still here in one piece. You may have to venture back into those ruins to acquire a weapon. There is a fortress nearby.

6,Out Of Reach,Glad to see you can keep up on the ground. Is that still true for the skies? Astratha is already bringing the dragons onto your world. We need to secure you a pair of wings.,1,-1,STONE2,Retrieve a Dragon Stone,2500,1000,i4w,2,

9,A Paragon Appears,Aurora is nearby. We need to seal some of his power or he will be the only fortress left standing.,1,4,,Defeat the Fortress Paragon,2500,1000,i3k,10,

13,The First Monster,I'm sorry… I've miscalculated. I did not think Tyra would be able to manifest in this plane. This is a disaster. If Tyra has come here then it's only a matter of time until the others make their move.,1,6,,Defeat the Demon Paragon,5000,2000,i5l,1,
14,A Firm Resolve,I'm impressed by how much you've grown so quickly. It looks like the True Paragons have not yet breached this dimension. We must take the fight to them and to do that we have to find a way to cross over into the outer dimensions.,20,3,,Breakthrough to level 50,5000,2000,i4z,1,
15,Crossing Of Worlds,It seems remnants of Astratha are still lingering. If we gather enough of them perhaps we can reforge his wings. With this maybe we can traverse the dimensional rift.,1,7,,Equip a pair of Dimensional Wings,15000,10000,tVII,1,Player Echelon 3
